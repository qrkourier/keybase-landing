## [NetFoundry](https://netfoundry.io/)

We're building high-security, high-performance, cloud-agnostic, application-specific, programmable WANs with the [NetFoundry](https://netfoundry.io/) platform.

## Ansible + Stacki
Stacki is an API for configuring bare-metal hosts. These Ansible roles [configure the Kickstart server](https://galaxy.ansible.com/qrkourier/stacki-frontend/) and [cluster parameters for the newly-provisioned metal](https://galaxy.ansible.com/qrkourier/stacki-backend/).

I gave [a talk about this](https://slideslive.com/38900726/postkick-cluster-independence-with-ansible) at StackiFest '17.

## [ShufflePad Sound Machine](https://github.com/qrkourier/shufflepad-sound-machine)
Continuously play sound effects separated by a random amount dead air on a Raspberry Pi ([more](https://github.com/qrkourier/shufflepad-sound-machine)).

## Art
I have and look forward to participating in future projects with [Tautology](http://tautology.io/), a playful arts collective focused on interactive installations.

## Music
I am fascinated by FM synthesis and digital signal processing and I occasionally get busy in [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com/) to produce original acoustic and electronic music. Even more occasionally I upload finished tracks to [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/qrkourier).

Here's a recent collaboration with Clarknova which was definitely a learning experience.

I also enjoy building playlists and some of these are published on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/128656604?si=Gihepa1zS9iOx3A2xvSYRg) like this one:

## Miscellaneous
I frequently contribute to open-source projects and post side projects of my own on [Github](https://github.com/qrkourier).
